        entry associated with the user. If `restaurant_name` is not provided, a default name will be generated.

        via the `/auth/register-staff` endpoint by an authenticated owner.

        - Password Management
      summary: Request password reset
      description: |
        Initiates the password reset process by sending a reset link to the user's email.

        **Process Flow:**
        1. User submits their email address
        2. System generates a secure reset token
        3. Reset link is sent to the user's email
        4. Token is valid for 1 hour
        5. User clicks the link to reset password

        **Security Features:**
        - Token is hashed before storage
        - Token expires after 1 hour
        - Only one active reset token per user
        - Original token is only sent via email

        **Note:** In development mode, the reset token may be included in the response for testing purposes.

      summary: Reset password using token
      description: |
        Resets the user's password using the token received via email.

        **Process:**
        1. User receives reset link via email
        2. Link contains the reset token
        3. User submits new password with the token
        4. System validates token and updates password
        5. User receives new JWT token for immediate login

        **Token Validation:**
        - Token must match the hashed token in database
        - Token must not be expired (1 hour validity)
        - Token is single-use (cleared after successful reset)

        **Security:**
        - New password is hashed before storage
        - Reset token is cleared after use
        - Returns new JWT for immediate authentication

      description: |
        Allows authenticated users to change their password by providing their current password.

        **Security Requirements:**
        - User must be authenticated (valid JWT token)
        - Current password must be correct
        - New password must meet minimum requirements (6+ characters)

        **Use Cases:**
        - User wants to update their password for security
        - Regular password rotation
        - Security best practices

        **Note:** This is different from password reset, which is used when the user forgot their password.
